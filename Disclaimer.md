**1. Automated Generation & Potential for Errors:**
The content within this repository (including news selections, summaries, headlines, and links) is generated and managed primarily by artificial intelligence systems. While these systems are designed to gather relevant information, AI is not infallible. There is a possibility of:
    *   **Inaccuracies:** Information presented may contain factual errors or misinterpretations.
    *   **Omissions:** Important context or details might be missing.
    *   **Bias:** AI algorithms can inherit or generate biases present in the source data or their own processing.
    *   **Hallucinations:** In some cases, AI might generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.
