**Daily Robotics and AI News — August 15, 2025**

**AI Innovation Highlights**

- *UC San Diego* researchers developed an AI tool that interprets medical images with drastically less data than traditional methods by mimicking radiologists’ focus on critical features. This advancement shows promise for tumor and lung condition diagnosis with minimal training data[1].

- *DeepCogito v2*, an open-source AI model, launched recently, demonstrates enhanced logical reasoning and long-horizon task planning. It outperforms many proprietary AI models in abstract reasoning and is gaining traction for its transparency and adaptability[1].

- *Johns Hopkins* AI called MAARS now detects heart risks from MRI scans more accurately than conventional guidelines, representing a breakthrough in AI medical diagnostics[4].

**Robotics Developments**

- MIT’s Prof. Daniela Rus and her team continue training humanoid robots like "Ruby" to perform everyday tasks such as making drinks at home. The focus is on enabling AI-powered robots to safely operate repeatedly in unpredictable, human-centered environments[3].

- *Amazon* announced a new AI foundation model powering its massive robotic fleet including its one-millionth industrial mobile robot, boosting efficiency and delivery accuracy[2].

- Texas is deploying AI-powered helicopters for surveillance with real-time video analysis and object tracking to support law enforcement and border monitoring. Privacy concerns have been raised regarding aerial surveillance[1].

- China's first store dedicated exclusively to AI-controlled robots opened in Beijing’s Yizhuang district, highlighting China’s leadership push in AI robotics for retail applications[5].

**Additional Relevant Tech News**

- Automated labs using AI are accelerating scientific discovery by performing real-time, dynamic chemical experiments that generate data up to 10 times faster than traditional methods[4].

- Breakthrough analysis of neural networks shows a phase transition in AI language understanding from simple word order puzzles to deep semantic meaning processing[4].

- Amazon is investing heavily in expanding AI infrastructure, including building a compute cluster with Trainium2 chips and investing AU$20 billion in Australian data center infrastructure to bolster AI capabilities[2].
