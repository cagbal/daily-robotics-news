**Daily Robotics and AI News â€“ August 2, 2025**

**1. Robotics in Logistics and Delivery**  
Amazon continues advancing robotic automation in logistics with its "Vulcan" robot, which uses tactile sensing to manipulate and organize packages in warehouses across Washington and Germany. In a new development, Amazon is collaborating with Unitree Robotics from China to develop humanoid delivery robots aimed at replacing human delivery drivers. This builds on previous, less successful projects like the "Scout" delivery trolleys (withdrawn in 2022) and drone delivery trials in the U.S. that faced technical and regulatory challenges.

**2. Innovative Robot Mobility and Transportation**  
At the April 2025 World Expo in Osaka, Kawasaki showcased "Corleo," a mechanical mount inspired by hyena locomotion that adapts to diverse terrains. This reflects the broader push toward robotics and AI enhancing both individual and collective transport safety and speed worldwide.

**3. Robotics Training Advances**  
MIT unveiled a 3-in-1 robot training system that enables robots to learn tasks from human demonstration without complex coding. Operators can teach robots through remote control, physical guidance, or performance observation, streamlining robot skill acquisition.

**4. Industry Partnerships and Deployments**  
NEURA Robotics partnered with HD Hyundai to develop quadruped and humanoid robots tailored for challenging shipbuilding environments, demonstrating the expanding industrial role of cognitive robots.

**5. AI and Energy Partnerships**  
The rapid growth of AI computing demands is leading major tech companies, including Microsoft and Google, to explore partnerships with nuclear energy providers. This aims to create sustainable, high-capacity power solutions for data centers and AI model training, signaling a shift in the AI energy landscape.

**6. New Robotics Research Highlights**  
- Engineers developed a transformer-like flying-rolling robot capable of midair shape-shifting for seamless operation transitions.  
- A breakthrough AI tool predicting the 3D structures of chromosomes at the single-cell level promises advances in genetic and biomedical research.  
- Scientists created a multifunctional photonic device for optical computing, combining light manipulation with memory functions.  
- Development continues on artificial tissue chips featuring natural blood vessels to reduce reliance on animal testing.
