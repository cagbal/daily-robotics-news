### Breakthrough Robotic Products and Demonstrations

At Auto Shanghai 2025, Xpang introduced *Iron*, a humanoid robot that blurs the lines between autonomous vehicles and service robots. Standing 5'8" and weighing 154 lbs, Iron boasts an impressive 60 joints, including 22 in its hands, enabling it to perform delicate tasks such as threading needles and handling porcelain cups with extraordinary precision. Powered by a custom AI chip capable of 3,000 trillion operations per second, Iron runs on the same neural AI system used in Xpang's self-driving cars, paving the way for a unified AI ecosystem where one intelligent brain controls diverse platforms—including future flying taxis. In live demonstrations, Iron walked, spoke fluent Mandarin, and demonstrated dexterity and social interaction skills, showcasing the future potential for humanoid robots in service and industrial roles.

Micropolis showcased its autonomous mobile robots equipped with AI designed to enhance productivity and reduce operational costs for businesses. This continues the trend of intelligent systems being used to optimize workflow in various sectors, emphasizing automation's productivity benefits.
