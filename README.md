**Daily Robotics and AI News — August 4, 2025**

1. **Skild AI Launches “Robot Brain” Cognitive Architecture**  
At the Skild AI annual developer summit, the company unveiled a next-generation cognitive framework designed to enable robots to plan, learn, and adapt in real time with flexibility approaching human levels. This architecture integrates symbolic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual adaptation, aiming to bridge the gap between specialized automation and generalist robotic assistants. The breakthrough is expected to boost deployments in service industries such as hotels, hospitals, and retail, where nuanced decision-making by robots is critical. Early-stage integrators are advised to test pilot kits and design human-in-the-loop safety protocols before larger scale adoption[1].

2. **NASA Deploys Autonomous Maintenance Robots on ISS**  
NASA has begun operations with two autonomous maintenance robots aboard the International Space Station. These robots undertake routine tasks including heat-shield inspections, inventory management, and minor repairs, operating primarily via onboard AI with only daily status uplinks to ground control. This advance in trusted autonomy marks significant progress toward fully autonomous operations for future deep-space missions, which face communication delays that hinder tele-operation. The technology also decreases astronaut workload and exposure to risk. Space agencies are encouraged to develop standardized autonomy certification and share telemetry data for mission improvement[1].

3. **Humanoid Robots Revolutionize Manufacturing in Europe and US**  
European manufacturers advanced the integration of humanoid robots with cognitive capabilities into production lines: Germany’s NEURA Robotics debuted its third-generation 4NE1, Switzerland’s Hexagon announced its AEON humanoid, and France’s Wandercraft partnered with Renault to develop the Calvin robot. These robots operate safely alongside humans, equipped with sensor “skins” and AI perception, helping mitigate labor shortages by taking on repetitive, heavy tasks. In a landmark industrial initiative, Foxconn and NVIDIA announced plans for deploying humanoid robots in assembly roles at a new AI server production plant in Houston starting Q1 2026. This collaboration marks the first known manufacturing of NVIDIA products assisted by humanoid robots, targeting precision tasks such as cable insertion and component placement[3].

4. **Robots with Enhanced Perception and Learning Abilities**  
Researchers have developed a novel perception framework called WildFusion that equips robots with a fusion of vision, vibration, and touch sensors, enabling navigation of complex outdoor terrain with human-like sensory abilities. In parallel, new cognitive simulations allow robots to learn social behaviors without early human intervention, signaling progress toward more autonomous robot training methods. These advances improve robots' adaptability and environmental interaction, which are crucial for real-world deployment[4].

5. **Regulation and AI Application Updates**  
- The EU AI Act officially entered into force, establishing regulatory frameworks for AI systems across Europe to ensure safety, transparency, and ethical standards[1].  
- OpenAI launched ChatGPT Study Mode globally, designed to assist students in learning by generating personalized study guides and explanations[1].
