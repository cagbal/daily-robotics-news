**Daily Robotics and AI News – August 1, 2025**

**Midea Unveils Advanced Humanoid Robot at WAIC 2025**  
At the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) held recently in Shanghai, Midea, parent company of Kuka Robotics, revealed a new humanoid robot prototype. This unveiling highlights Midea’s significant investment in embodied intelligence—the integration of robotics, AI, and real-world interaction. Midea has invested around $208 million into this technology platform and expanded its R&D budget by over 13% to $1.57 billion by early 2025. The conference showcased over 150 humanoid robots from 80+ companies, introducing more than 60 new models aimed at commercial applications. Demonstrations included live boxing matches between robots and even robots playing mahjong, highlighting both entertainment and practical advances such as robotic arms powered by Tencent Robotics X’s large language model with dual-arm integration and autonomous command rejection[1].

**Notable Industry Developments and Partnerships**  
July 2025 saw major robotics funding rounds and new deployments. Key highlights include:

- **MIT’s 3-in-1 Robot Training Tool:** This tool enables easier teaching of robots by demonstration, allowing users to train robots via remote control, physically guiding them, or performing the task for the robot to mimic. This lowers the barrier to programming by enabling natural human-robot interaction[3].

- **NEURA Robotics & HD Hyundai Partnership:** NEURA Robotics is collaborating with HD Hyundai Samho and HD Hyundai Robotics to develop quadruped and humanoid robots tailored for the shipbuilding industry—a challenging industrial environment that demands high adaptability and cognitive capabilities from robots[3].

**Emerging Trends in AI and Robotics**  
- The robotics sector is moving rapidly from prototypes to commercially viable products, highlighted by the WAIC 2025’s large-scale humanoid robot showcase[1].  
- Advances in robotic arms and sensory feedback systems are enabling robots to interpret and autonomously reject irrational commands, pointing toward safer and more intelligent automation[1].  
- AI’s growing computational and energy demands are driving partnerships between Big Tech and sustainable energy providers, including nuclear power, to support future AI infrastructure reliably and sustainably[5].

**Research and Resources**  
For those interested in in-depth research and background on AI and robotics, Shippensburg University’s Artificial Intelligence and Robotics guide offers curated sources, including news, journal articles, and reports spanning topics like machine learning, cognitive robotics, and soft robotics[2]. Additional robotics news on the latest research and innovations can be tracked continuously through platforms like ScienceDaily[4].
