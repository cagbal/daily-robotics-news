*Tuesday, August 5, 2025*

**1. Skild AI Launches Advanced Robot Brain Architecture**  
At its annual developer summit, Skild AI unveiled a next-generation cognitive architecture called the “Robot Brain” that enables robots to plan, learn, and adapt in real time with near-human flexibility. This architecture integrates symbolic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual adaptation, aiming to bridge the gap between specialized automation and generalist robotic assistants. This innovation targets deployment in service industries such as hotels, hospitals, and retail, where complex decision-making is essential. Robotics integrators are advised to engage with pilot kits and safety protocols before full adoption.

**2. NASA Deploys Autonomous Maintenance Robots on ISS**  
NASA recently deployed two autonomous robots aboard the International Space Station to conduct heat-shield inspections, inventory checks, and minor repairs entirely through onboard AI systems, requiring only daily status updates to ground control. This marks a milestone in trusted autonomy in space, reducing astronaut workload and risk, and enables prospective deep-space missions where real-time remote control is impractical due to communication delays. Space agencies are encouraged to create standardized autonomy-certification frameworks to leverage such technologies effectively.

**3. Open-Source AI Advances with DeepCogito v2**  
DeepCogito v2, an open-source AI released in early August, demonstrates major improvements in logical reasoning and long-horizon planning, outperforming many closed models in abstract tasks. Its transparency and modifiability have garnered widespread adoption, marking a significant win for open-source innovation in advanced AI capabilities.

**4. Innovations in Robotics Mobility: Transformer-like Flying and Rolling Robots**  
Engineering teams have developed a robotic drone capable of midair transformation, allowing smooth transition from flying to rolling on the ground without interruption. This design advances versatility and continuous operation, potentially impacting search and rescue, surveillance, and delivery robotics.

**5. Environmental Impact of AI Models**  
Recent research highlights varying carbon footprints among large language models (LLMs), with some generating up to 50 times more CO2 emissions than others despite similar accuracy. These findings encourage users and developers to consider energy efficiency when selecting or developing AI models.

**6. AI in Emotional and Social Contexts**  
- Scientists show machine learning tools can predict human emotional states from brief audio clips (~1.5 seconds) with accuracy comparable to humans.  
- New AI-powered apps are emerging to monitor children's emotional well-being online, alerting parents to distress or bullying signals, raising both opportunities and privacy concerns.
