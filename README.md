## Latest Updates

### üè≠ **Warehouse Automation Breakthroughs**  
**Robust.AI expands Carter‚Äôs collaborative robotics** to create a multi-functional warehouse platform combining fulfillment picking, transport, and mobile sorting. Deployments at companies like DHL have delivered **over 60% productivity gains** within weeks, emphasizing a "Robotics-as-a-Service" payment model where customers only pay after performance targets are met. CEO Anthony Jules emphasized design principles focused on **human-robot collaboration**: "Carter enables effortless interaction, setting new standards for adaptability".

### ü§ñ **Humanoid Robots Reshape Entertainment**  
The U.S. humanoid robots for entertainment market is projected to grow at a **36.8% CAGR**, driven by AI-powered interactive experiences and strong consumer demand. Despite **tariff-related challenges** (e.g., increased sensor/AI chip costs), companies are relocating production to Opportunity Zones for tax benefits and reshoring to reduce supply chain risks.

### üìΩÔ∏è **AI Learns from How-To Videos**  
Cornell University‚Äôs **RHyME framework** enables robots to learn tasks by watching a single instructional video, bypassing traditional data-intensive training. "RHyME could fast-track deployment by reducing the need for step-by-step programming," said researcher Kushal Kedia. The system addresses real-world hiccups like dropped tools, making robots more resilient.

### üöß **Industry Trends**  
- **AI productivity focus**: Manufacturers increasingly deploy AI/robotics to shorten workweeks while maintaining output.  
- **Collaborative robotics**: Human-centered design dominates new releases, with systems like Carter prioritizing intuitive operation over full automation.
