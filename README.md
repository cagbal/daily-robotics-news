## Daily Robotics and AI News — June 25, 2025

### Industry Awards and Recognition
- EY US and Bayer jointly won the prestigious “Artificial Intelligence for Good” Award at the 2025 AI Breakthrough Awards. These awards recognize outstanding AI companies and products that deliver positive societal impact across areas including generative AI[1].

### Breakthroughs in Robotics AI Models
- Google DeepMind announced the Gemini Robotics On-Device AI model designed to run locally on robots without the need for cloud connectivity. This innovation promises low-latency, cloud-free robotic control, enabling more responsive and autonomous robot operation for developers and manufacturers[2].

### Investment and Market Trends in Robotics
- The robotics and AI investment sector is witnessing accelerating mergers and acquisitions, with over half of the companies in key indexes being small- and mid-cap firms attractive for buyouts or partnerships.  
- Global industrial reshoring is driving infrastructure buildout, especially in semiconductor and data center sectors, with over $100 billion committed recently.  
- Key collaborations from the recent NVIDIA Paris GTC conference include Schneider Electric teaming with NVIDIA to create AI-ready infrastructure for smart factories in Europe; Nebius Group launching NVIDIA Blackwell systems for on-demand AI capacity; and Supermicro expanding support for NVIDIA AI Factory Stack in Europe[3].

### Advances in Autonomous Robotics Research
- The University of the Witwatersrand’s RAIL Lab is advancing autonomous AI by training robots to perform complex tasks such as navigating underground caves, pouring liquids, and human-like planning. Their work pushes the frontier of “bots with brains” capable of independent decision-making in challenging environments[4].

### Notable Robotics and AI Innovations
- A new four-legged AI-powered robot developed in China can play badminton against human players by leveraging vision systems, sensors, and machine learning to anticipate and respond to shots in real time, showcasing the future potential of human-robot sports collaboration[5].  
- Thinking Machines Lab, led by Mira Murati, has raised $2 billion at a $10 billion valuation to develop next-generation agentic AI systems focused on autonomy, reasoning, and planning—positioning itself as a major competitor in foundational AI[5].  
- Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to develop AI-first solutions for business transformation using Azure OpenAI services, with plans to upskill 100,000 employees in generative AI technologies[5].
